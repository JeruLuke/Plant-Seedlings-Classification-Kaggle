Dataset : 512 x 512, padded with gray. Images greater than 512 were resized to the same, while images lesser than that were padded to 512.
Preprocessing : Image padding
Data Augmentation : None


Classes were highly skewed.

Validation loss comparitively lower than previous model with some negligible (~0.1%) accuracy.

More data is needed to train the model.
