Data size : 512 reduced to 250 as input for the neural network
Data Augmentation :  randomly chose 1000 images after augmenting 
Preprocessing : Image padding with gray

Validation performance reduced drastically compared to previous model.

Original size was 512 (including padding), but the image size was reduced to 250 to fit network contrains. Hence small images would have squashed.
